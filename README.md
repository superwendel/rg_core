# rg_core by Reverse Gravity

`rg_core` is a set of header-only C modules designed for unity builds. It
provides memory arenas, containers, hashing, sorting, binary I/O, strings,
math, timing, logging, assertions, formatting, and a small SDL3 foundation.
These are the foundational modules I use to make games at Reverse Gravity.

The supported library interface is C. Some benchmarks require C++17 to build.

`rg_core` is not intended to be a general-purpose answer for every use case. It
is the code I use to make games, released because its focused approach
outperformed many popular libraries in the workloads I measured.

Functions use internal linkage, so there is no implementation macro or
separate C library target. Module-level state, such as the memory pool and
logger settings, is local to each translation unit. A unity build shares that
state across the program.

Add `rg_core/src` to the compiler include path and include only the modules you
use. Most modules depend only on the C standard library. `rg_sdl.h`,
`rg_window.h`, `rg_input.h`, and `rg_gpu.h` require SDL3. The hybrid formatter
can optionally use an x64 assembly object.

## Quick start

This example opens a resizable SDL3 window and exits when you close it or press
Escape. Install an [SDL3 development package](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases)
before building it. SDL3 is only required by the SDL modules; the other modules
remain independently usable.

```c
#include "rg_input.h"
#include "rg_log.h"
#include "rg_sdl.h"
#include "rg_window.h"

int main(void)
{
	rg_log_init(RG_LOG_INFO);

	if (!rg_sdl_init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO))
	{
		RG_ERROR("SDL initialization failed: %s", rg_sdl_error());
		return 1;
	}

	RgWindowDesc desc = {0};
	desc.title = "rg_core quickstart";
	desc.width = 1280;
	desc.height = 720;
	desc.flags = SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE;

	SDL_Window* window = rg_window_create(&desc);
	if (!window)
	{
		RG_ERROR("Window creation failed: %s", rg_sdl_error());
		rg_sdl_quit();
		return 1;
	}

	RgInputState input;
	rg_input_init(&input);

	int running = 1;
	while (running)
	{
		rg_input_begin_frame(&input);

		SDL_Event event;
		while (SDL_PollEvent(&event))
		{
			rg_input_process_event(&input, &event);

			if (event.type == SDL_EVENT_QUIT ||
			    event.type == SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_CLOSE_REQUESTED)
			{
				running = 0;
			}
		}

		rg_input_sample(&input);
		if (rg_input_is_key_pressed(&input, SDL_SCANCODE_ESCAPE))
		{
			running = 0;
		}

		// Update and render your game here.
	}

	rg_window_destroy(window);
	rg_sdl_quit();
	return 0;
}
```

MSVC (from a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt):

```bat
cl /nologo /std:c11 /W4 /O2 ^
   /I path\to\rg_core\src /I "%SDL3_DIR%\include" example.c ^
   /link /LIBPATH:"%SDL3_DIR%\lib\x64" SDL3.lib
set "PATH=%SDL3_DIR%\lib\x64;%PATH%"
example.exe
```

Set `SDL3_DIR` to the SDL3 development package root before building. Its
`lib\x64` directory must contain both `SDL3.lib` and `SDL3.dll`.

GCC or Clang (with SDL3 available through `pkg-config`):

```sh
cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O2 \
   -Ipath/to/rg_core/src $(pkg-config --cflags sdl3) \
   example.c -o example $(pkg-config --libs sdl3)
./example
```

See the [`rg_sdl`](docs/rg_sdl.md), [`rg_window`](docs/rg_window.md),
[`rg_input`](docs/rg_input.md), and [`rg_log`](docs/rg_log.md) guides for the
complete APIs.

## Integration at a glance

Add `rg_core/src` to the include path and include only the headers you use.
Define configuration macros before the first include of the affected module in
each translation unit.

| Module | Additional requirements | Setup and teardown | State and lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rg_defs`, `rg_bin`, `rg_algo`, `rg_math` | None | No initialization | Stateless; callers own all input and output storage. |
| `rg_random` | None | Seed each `RgRng` with `rg_rng_seed` | RNG state is caller-owned. |
| `rg_sprintf` | Optional x64 assembly helper for the hybrid path | No initialization | Output buffers are caller-owned; formatter selection is translation-unit-wide. |
| `rg_assert` | Optional `rg_log`; include the logger first for automatic integration | No initialization | Behavior is configured at compile time. |
| `rg_mem` | Native virtual-memory backend | Call `rg_malloc`, create arenas, then call `rg_free` after all arena users are finished | The pool is translation-unit-local; allocations are invalidated by arena reset/free or pool release. |
| `rg_containers`, `rg_hash` | An initialized `rg_mem` arena | Define typed containers at file scope, then initialize each value with an arena | Container storage and returned pointers are invalidated when the arena is reset or released. |
| `rg_string` | An initialized `rg_mem` arena for `RgString`; none for in-place helpers | Initialize each `RgString`; release its backing arena after all strings are finished | String buffers are arena-owned; in-place helpers use caller buffers. |
| `rg_time` | Native Windows, Linux, or macOS backend, or custom hooks | `rg_time_init` is optional but caches conversion frequency | The frequency cache is translation-unit-local. |
| `rg_prof` | An initialized arena; `rg_time` when recording is enabled | Enable at compile time, initialize the profiler, and register each thread | Profiler storage is arena-backed; each producer thread owns one registered handle. |
| `rg_log` | `rg_sprintf`; optional x64 assembly helper | `rg_log_init` optionally sets the initial level | Logger configuration and level are translation-unit-local. |
| `rg_sdl` | SDL3 | Call `rg_sdl_init`, then destroy SDL resources before `rg_sdl_quit` | SDL owns its process-wide subsystem state. |
| `rg_window` | SDL3 with the video subsystem initialized | Create and destroy each window | Window handles are owned by the caller. |
| `rg_input` | SDL3 event processing | Initialize caller storage; begin each frame, process events, then sample before gameplay | Immediate state and optional event queues are caller-owned. |
| `rg_gpu` | SDL3 with video initialized and compiled shaders for shader-loading helpers | Create a device, claim windows, release GPU resources and windows, then destroy the device | GPU handles are caller-owned and follow SDL synchronization rules. |

Functions use internal linkage. In a unity build, translation-unit-local state
is shared by the whole program. With conventional separate compilation, each
translation unit gets its own `rg_mem` pool, logger level, and timing cache; keep
stateful module calls in one translation unit unless that separation is
intentional.

## Performance

The following figures are historical measurements. Use the
[current benchmark commands](docs/benchmarks/README.md) to measure this revision.

| Workload | rg_core time | Compared with | Comparison time | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Mixed formatting | 109.42 ns/call | `stb_sprintf` 1.10 | 306.33 ns/call | **2.8x** |
| Shared 3D hot-path model | 1.14 ms | cglm 0.9.6 | 1.50 ms | **1.3x** |
| One million random `int32`, radix sort | 15.38 ms | `std::sort` | 89.63 ms | **5.8x** |
| 500,000-entry reserved map insert | 25.81 ms | `std::unordered_map` | 79.91 ms | **3.1x** |
| 200,000 sparse-set inserts | 0.38 ms | EnTT 3.13.2 | 2.01 ms | **5.3x** |
| 200,000 sparse-set removals | 0.20 ms | EnTT 3.13.2 | 1.70 ms | **8.5x** |

Lower time is better and speedup is comparison time divided by `rg_core` time;
results are machine- and workload-specific, so see the complete
[benchmark reports](docs/benchmarks/README.md) for charts and methodology.

## Build, test, and benchmark

From a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt:

```bat
build.bat test
```

The aggregate target exercises portable, SIMD, assembly, secure, custom, and
configured C builds. When SDL3 is available, it also runs
the SDL foundation and input suites; set `SDL3_DIR` to select an SDL3
development package explicitly.

Run the algorithm, hash, and container benchmarks with three-process medians:

```bat
build.bat bench_median
```

Use `build.bat bench` for a quicker one-process diagnostic pass. Set
`RG_BENCH_DEPS` to enable the optional quadsort, crumsort, `stb_ds`, and EnTT
comparisons described in the benchmark reports.

Use `build.bat bench_regression` for the math, formatter, storage, input,
and profiler regression workloads. See the [benchmark guide](docs/benchmarks/README.md)
for paired before/after runs and optional comparison dependencies.

## Inspiration

The [Handmade community](https://handmade.network/) has shaped this project
through its emphasis on simple, direct, understandable software and deliberate
control over the systems a game depends on.

`rg_sprintf` was inspired by Sean Barrett's
[`stb_sprintf`](https://github.com/nothings/stb). It targets the common game and
real-time formatting workloads where a smaller focused formatter can go faster,
with a portable C fallback and optional x64 assembly acceleration.
