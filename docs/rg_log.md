# rg_log

`rg_log.h` is a small, unity-friendly logger for C. It adds severity filtering,
source locations, optional color and timestamps, and uses `rg_sprintf` for
message formatting.

## Integration

```c
#include "rg_log.h"

int main(void)
{
  rg_log_init(RG_LOG_DEBUG);
  RG_INFO("Server started on port %d", 8080);
  return 0;
}
```

The header includes `rg_sprintf_hybrid.h`. On MSVC x64 AVX2 builds, link the
Windows assembly helper described in the [rg_sprintf documentation](rg_sprintf.md),
or define `RG_SPRINTF_NO_ASM` to use the portable path.

The header intentionally has no include guard and should be included once in a
unity translation unit. Its `static` state is then shared by every source file
in that unity build. Separately compiled translation units each receive their
own logger state.

## Configuration

Define options before including the header:

```c
#define RG_LOG_TIMESTAMP        // Add an HH:MM:SS timestamp
#define RG_LOG_STRIP_EXTENSION  // Show main instead of main.c
#define RG_LOG_NO_COLOR         // Disable ANSI color sequences
#define RG_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE 1024 // Default: 512 bytes
#include "rg_log.h"
```

Messages that exceed the buffer are truncated while retaining a final newline
and null terminator.

With `RG_LOG_TIMESTAMP`, each thread caches the formatted `HH:MM:SS` text and
only calls `localtime` again when the second changes, so the timestamp adds a
`time()` call rather than a microsecond of calendar conversion to every line.
The cache is thread-local and the conversion uses `localtime_r` or MSVC's
`localtime_s` when the build exposes them (the native build script's
`-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L` does), so the option does not add shared mutable
state to the logger.

## API

```c
void rg_log_init(RgLogLevel level);
void rg_log_set_level(RgLogLevel level);
RgLogLevel rg_log_get_level(void);

RG_DEBUG("frame=%u", frame);
RG_INFO("Loaded %s", path);
RG_WARN("Frame spike: %.2f ms", elapsed_ms);
RG_ERROR("Could not open %s", path);
RG_CRIT("Out of memory");
```

Levels range from `RG_LOG_DEBUG` through `RG_LOG_CRIT`; `RG_LOG_NONE` disables
all messages. Filtered macro calls do not evaluate their formatting arguments.
The macros compare the level inline against the logger's level variable and
call out of line only for messages that pass, so a filtered `RG_DEBUG` is a
single predictable branch and each call site is a few dozen bytes.

## Output

The default format is:

```text
[INFO] game.c:42: Loaded player.mesh
```

DEBUG and INFO write to buffered `stdout`. WARN, ERROR, and CRIT write to
`stderr`; ERROR and CRIT explicitly flush their stream. ANSI colors are enabled
by default and can be disabled for files or CI with `RG_LOG_NO_COLOR`.

## Assertions

Include `rg_assert.h` after `rg_log.h` to route assertion reports through
`RG_CRIT` automatically:

```c
#include "rg_log.h"
#include "rg_assert.h"

RG_ASSERT_MSG(ptr != NULL, "Allocation failed");
```
